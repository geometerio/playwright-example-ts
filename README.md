# Playwright Example in TypeScript

The point is to get a concurrent multi-user video room example running that can be used as inspiration and guide for implementing [`playwright-elixir`](https://github.com/geometerio/playwright-elixir).

## Usage

Assuming the Node.js packages are installed, run the tests as follows:

```shell
# initial project setup, within the repo...
$ cat .envrc # ...and, if you're happy with that:
$ direnv allow

# run the browser-server and specs (in separate terminals)...
$ run-server
$ run-specs
```
